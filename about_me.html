    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in a South Asian Country called Bangladesh. And I lived there
      almost my entire childhood. I then moved to USA in order to persue my
      Secondary and Higher Education here. This significant move was fueled by
      my determination to explore new horizons, gain advanced expertise, and
      achieve academic excellence. However, despite my physical distance from
      Bangladesh, my heart remains deeply connected to my roots. I embody a
      strong sense of patriotism and remain actively engaged with the
      Bangladeshi community.

          Besides my home school HSGC, I am also a student in the Brooklyn Steam
          Center, which is an innovative career and technical training hub for
          11th and 12th-grade students. It offers a unique learning environment
          where students engage in hands-on, project-based education. In here I
          focused on learning Computer Science, but primarily Full Stack

          My journey into coding began with a spark of curiosity and a desire to
          create. I started with learning the basics of programming and soon
          found myself engrossed in building a text-based adventure game.
          Moreover, I learned how to code in HTML, CSS and started making
          wonderful websites.

          I always wandered how devices communicate within a system. Thus I
          learned networking and began by grasping fundamental concepts such as
          IP addressing, subnets, and routing, which quickly piqued my
          curiosity. Learning networking made me developed a skill, which is
          making ethernet cables, which are used to connect devices to a
          network, providing a reliable, high speed wired connection for data
          transmisson.

          Growing up I loved maths. It has been my favourite subject in schools
          since my childhood. And because of my dedication and continuous
          learning, I've mastered various mathematical concepts and techniques.
          My ability to solve complex problems, analyze data, and think
          critically has been honed through rigorous study and practice. Thus I
          got proficient in Algebra, Arithmetics, Geometry, Trigonometry,
          Statistics, Calculus. But I am still learning more and have a lot more
          to cover.

          various concepts, which includes Newtonian Mechanics, Motion,
          Thermodynamics, Electricity, Sound Waves, Vector and many more.

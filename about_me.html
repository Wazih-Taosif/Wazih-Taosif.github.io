    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p class="mybackground-text">
      I was born in a South Asian Country called Bangladesh. And I lived there
      almost my entire childhood. I then moved to USA in order to persue my
      Secondary and Higher Education here. This significant move was fueled by
      my determination to explore new horizons, gain advanced expertise, and
      achieve academic excellence. However, despite my physical distance from
      Bangladesh, my heart remains deeply connected to my roots. I embody a
      strong sense of patriotism and remain actively engaged with the
      Bangladeshi community.

          I completed my primary, middle, as well as my 9th and 10th grade
          education from 'Chittagong Grammar School National Curriculum.' Which
          is one of Bangladesh's most esteemed educational institutions. It's
          renowned for its acedemic excellence and holistic approach to
          education. This school provided an environment that nurtured my
          intellectual curiosity and personal growth. <br />

          My educational journey took a significant turn when I attended High
          School For Global Citizenship in New York City. HSGC is celebrated for
          its high academic standards and innovative educational approach,
          offering students a unique and enriching learning environment. The
          school's dedicated faculty and cutting-edge facilities provided the
          perfect backdrop for my academic and personal growth. <br />

          Besides my home school HSGC, I am also a student in the Brooklyn Steam
          Center, which is an innovative career and technical training hub for
          11th and 12th-grade students. It offers a unique learning environment
          where students engage in hands-on, project-based education. In here I
          focused on learning Computer Science, but primarily Full Stack
          Development. <br />

    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p>
      Besides my interests in programming, I do have other interests. Some of
      them are listed below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mathematics</li>
      <p>Math is one of my favourite subject to study. The reason being its really easy and the concepts are fun.</p>
      <li>Physics</li>
      <p>Once again like math, I like physics a lot due to it being a really fun and interesting subject.</p>
      <li>Video Games</li>
      <p>Like most teenagers, I do like games. They are fun to play and make my mind relaxed after a long day of school.</p>
    </ul>

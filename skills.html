          My journey into coding began with a spark of curiosity and a desire to
          create. I started with learning the basics of programming and soon
          found myself engrossed in building a text-based adventure game using
          python. Moreover, I learned how to code in HTML, CSS and started
          making wonderful websites.

          I always wandered how devices communicate within a system. Thus I
          learned networking and began by grasping fundamental concepts such as
          IP addressing, subnets, and routing, which quickly piqued my
          curiosity. Learning networking made me develop a skill, which is
          making ethernet cables, which are used to connect devices to a
          network, providing a reliable, high speed wired connection for data
          transmisson.

          I have a growing skill set in cybersecurity and a solid understanding
          of the basics, such as network security, common threats, and how to
          protect systems from attacks. I'm familiar with tools and practices
          used to keep information safe, and I'm continuously learning more
          through hands-on experience and training. I'm confident in my ability
          to spot potential issues and take steps to improve security.

          Growing up I loved maths. It has been my favourite subject in schools
          since my childhood. And because of my dedication and continuous
          learning, I've mastered various mathematical concepts and techniques.
          My ability to solve complex problems, analyze data, and think
          critically has been honed through rigorous study and practice. Thus I
          got proficient in Algebra, Arithmetics, Geometry, Trigonometry,
          Statistics, Calculus. But I am still learning more and have a lot more
          to cover.
